# COMPSS 211A practice studio

A course page with a cumulative self-check, browser-saved practice, automatic anonymous activity tracking,
54 skill-specific quick checks, nine deeper examples across filtering,
functions, and debugging, and 47 code drills. The checklist is the home page. All 57 skill titles
and their Open practice links lead directly to a stable #skill/<id> route.

## Weekly maintenance

The checklist defaults to **Covered through Week N**. It calculates the current
course week in the browser using `America/Los_Angeles`, so GitHub Pages needs no
weekly rebuild, scheduled workflow, or manual update. An open checklist refreshes
within a minute of a release and when the student returns to the tab.

`schedule.mjs` lists the actual Fall 2026 bCourses week-start dates. Week 1 begins
August 31 and lasts two calendar weeks; Week 2 begins September 14. Week 4 opens
September 28, and subsequent course weeks open each Monday at midnight Berkeley
time through Week 13 on November 30. Adjust that list for a revised calendar or
another semester. To preview before a release, add `?preview` to the address (every
week) or `?preview=5` (the course as of Week 5); the interactives homepage has the same
`?preview` switch and passes it on to the studio. Preview shows drills and skills early
and doesn't record activity for the class report. It is a display switch, not a lock.
**Entire course** remains available for looking ahead; future
skills are labeled. This is a display filter, not an access restriction. It uses
the device clock. No “First introduced” filter remains.

Add or revise skill descriptions, resource links, and `releaseWeek` values there.
Keep each skill's `id` unchanged: saved ratings are tied to IDs, not row order.
The catalog is a snapshot of the Google Sheet, not a live connection to it.
SQL remains in the catalog; its current notebook link is provisional.

Students return to the same URL. Their ratings stay in localStorage under
`compss-211a-practice-v1`. The course link enables automatic anonymous activity tracking. It records fixed outcome labels and self-ratings; code drafts and typed answers never leave the browser.
Progress moves between browsers or website origins only if the student turns on
sync (below) or exports a JSON backup and merges it on another device; newer ratings
and code drafts win, and practice results are combined. The app does not collect
student names, IDs, or grades. Normal host/CDN access logging still applies.

## Progress sync

Students who use more than one device can turn on sync under **Backup & sync**.
The browser creates a random 16-character sync code (for example `7KQ3-M9TX-4HRP-2WZB`)
and the Worker stores one copy of the progress per code in the D1 table `progress_sync`,
keyed by a SHA-256 hash of the code. Entering the code on another device merges both
copies. Ratings, practice results, code drill results, and flashcard schedules are synced.
Code drafts are never sent, and the Worker keeps only fixed labels, booleans, numbers,
and dates (`syncedProgress` in `progress-sync.mjs`). Sync copies are separate from the
activity table and the class report, and there is no API that lists them.

Each copy has a revision number. A browser with no unsent changes takes a newer copy
as it is, so clearing a rating on one device clears it on the others. Unsent changes are
merged with the newer copy, and a write based on an old revision is refused and merged
again. The first check after a page opens always merges, so a browser that lost its
saved progress gets it back. Stopping sync, or clearing progress on the Backup page,
disconnects that browser but leaves the synced copy for reconnecting.

Anyone with a sync code can read and change that copy, and the page tells students
to keep the code private. The Worker refuses new codes after 5,000 copies. To remove
all copies at the end of the term, run
`npx wrangler@4 d1 execute compss-211a-practice --remote --command "DELETE FROM progress_sync"`.
Sync is unavailable on a plain local preview; `scripts/preview.mjs` serves its own API
and points the page at it.

## Exercise behavior

`skill-checks.mjs` contains a unique question, answer choices, feedback, and hint
for each of the 54 quick-check skills. `exercises.mjs` contains the three deeper
activities, task variants, feedback rules, hints and worked solutions.
Filtering and debugging are guided prediction/diagnosis exercises, not a Python
editor. Functions execute real Python in a disposable-capable Web Worker using
Pyodide 314.0.7 from jsDelivr. No pandas or API credentials are needed. Download
failures have a retry path and notebook alternative; a Stop button and six-second
execution timeout handle runaway code. Code drafts survive stopping a run.
Passing an example never sets a self-rating automatically.

## Code drills

Open `#drills` from the navigation, a skill page's “Practise by writing code” list,
or the “Code drills: n of m done” link on a checklist row. Each drill (`#drill/<id>`)
has students write real Python on course data: the HW1 commute survey, gapminder,
and the Week 4–5 SF311 requests with the supervisor-districts table. There are two
kinds: fill-in-the-code drills with an explanation and a runnable example, and
“Write it yourself” drills that start from an empty editor and report a list of tests.

`drills.mjs` holds the drills. Each one has a stable `id`, one catalog `skill`, and a
`week`; it appears when that course week starts, like the checklist. Check runs the
student's code and the model answer in fresh namespaces, then compares the named
results. It then runs both again with different inputs (changed starting values, or
a 60% sample of the table), so typing in the printed result does not pass. After
adding or editing a drill, run `uv run python docs/practice/scripts/check_drills.py`
from the repository. It confirms that each model answer passes, each starter fails,
and each second run changes the answer. `npm test` checks IDs, skills, and weeks.

## Python and pandas reference

The reference view (`#functions`) lists what students write in the course, grouped by
the job it does. Each entry has a short example with its real output, the week it
opens, and a link to its skill. “Try it” runs the example in the drill worker.

The entries are written in `scripts/build_reference.py`, which runs every example in
real Python on the practice data and writes `reference.mjs`. After adding or editing
an entry, run `uv run python docs/practice/scripts/build_reference.py` from the
repository; with `--check` it fails if `reference.mjs` is out of date. Examples that
need the network, a key or a spreadsheet are marked `run=False` and say so in a note.

Drills run in `drill-worker.mjs`, a Web Worker with Pyodide 0.27.7 and pandas 2.2.3
from jsDelivr (about 30 MB on first use, then cached). This is a separate runtime from
the function exercise, matching the course interactives.
A Stop button and a 15-second timeout end runaway code. The tables in
`drill-data.mjs` load only in the worker.

Seven Week 5 drills practise SQL (`sql-basics`). They use the `sf311sql` setup, which
mirrors the Week 5 notebook: it leaves out the Test request, loads `requests` and
`districts` into an in-memory SQLite database, and defines `sql(query)`, which returns
a pandas table. Students fill in or write queries inside `sql("""...""")`, and the check
compares the resulting tables. The worker loads Pyodide's `sqlite3` package the first
time a SQL drill runs. `"sql": true` in a drill's check makes the row-count hint mention
`LEFT JOIN` instead of `groupby`.

Passing a drill marks it done (under `drills` in the progress record) and offers the
skill's self-check. It never sets a rating. Drafts are saved as `drill:<id>`. Backups
include both, and a merge keeps a drill done if it was done on either device. The
drill list can show only drills for skills rated yellow or red.

## Develop and publish

No build dependencies are required. Run `npm test` for the logic and Python
checks, and `npm run build` to assemble a static `dist/`, or `npm run build:hosted` for the Sites Worker. The GitHub Pages copy needs no build. Node 18 or newer is required. The root files
can also be served as-is under the course's existing GitHub Pages `docs/practice/`
path. The parent course repository is not pushed by the private Sites deployment.

The Sites deployment collects anonymous activity. The instructor report lives in a private Google Sheet, with no instructor interface on the student website. Its public student audience still requires explicit approval before activation. The GitHub Pages copy remains static and cannot receive activity.

## Tracking on GitHub Pages

GitHub Pages serves the studio at `https://macss-berkeley.github.io/compss-211a/practice/`
but can't receive data. The Pages copy therefore sends anonymous activity to a small
Cloudflare Worker (`worker.mjs`, configured in `wrangler.toml`), which runs the same
`server.mjs` API and report with a Cloudflare D1 database. Only `/api/activity` and
`/api/report.csv` live there. `activity-config.mjs` picks where activity goes:
the Worker for github.io, nothing for a local preview, and the same site for the Sites build.

The browser sends plain text with its anonymous key in the body. This is a simple
cross-site request, so no CORS preflight is needed. The Worker accepts it only from
the sites in `ALLOWED_ORIGINS`, and all the checks above still apply.

One-time setup (the free Workers plan is enough). Wrangler needs Node 20 or newer; with
an older Node, prefix each command with `npx -p node@22 -p wrangler@4` in place of `npx wrangler@4`:

1. Create a Cloudflare account, then run `npx wrangler@4 login` in `docs/practice`.
2. `npx wrangler@4 d1 create compss-211a-practice`, and paste the `database_id` into `wrangler.toml`.
3. `npx wrangler@4 d1 migrations apply compss-211a-practice --remote` (run it again after adding a migration,
   such as `0002_progress_sync.sql` for progress sync, then redeploy the Worker)
4. `npx wrangler@4 secret put CLASS_CODE` and `npx wrangler@4 secret put REPORT_KEY`
   (48 random hex characters for the class code, for example from `openssl rand -hex 24`).
5. `npx wrangler@4 deploy`, and put the printed `https://…workers.dev` address in
   `PAGES_ACTIVITY_URL` in `activity-config.mjs`. Commit and push.
6. The class link is `https://macss-berkeley.github.io/compss-211a/practice/#class/<CLASS_CODE>`.
   The Sheet imports `https://…workers.dev/api/report.csv?key=<REPORT_KEY>&days=7`.

Progress is saved per website, so progress from another copy of the studio doesn't
appear automatically. Students can move it with Backup → Download progress there,
then restore the file on the Pages copy.

## Flashcards

Open `#flashcards` from the navigation or use the Flashcards link beside a skill.
The 100 cards in `flashcards.mjs` cover Python, pandas, SQL, and analysis decisions. Coverage defaults to the
current course week; Entire course allows review ahead. Prompts require recall
rather than choosing from multiple-choice answers. Students may type a temporary
answer before revealing the answer; this scratch text is not saved after reload.

Reviews are saved under `flashcards` in the existing progress record. Again returns
a card in 1 minute; Hard in 10 minutes for new/learning cards; Good in 1 day; Easy
in 4 days. For established cards, Hard increases the interval by 1.2x, Good by 2x,
and Easy by 3x (rounded up, capped at 365 days). Again resets the interval.
This is a simple interval schedule, not FSRS or an estimate of mastery. Due cards
come before unseen cards. Review ahead is optional when no cards are due.
Flashcard reviews do not set the checklist's self-ratings. Backups include review
schedules, merge the most recent review per card, and accept older backups.
Dates use the device clock; progress remains local to this browser and origin.


## Automatic activity and private reporting

The class link is stored in the instructor's private Google Sheet. It opens the
practice homepage and enables automatic tracking in that browser. A visible
notice explains tracking before students interact. There is no Share button,
manual submission, instructor page, or instructor navigation link.

Tracked events: completed checks (pass/fail), code drill checks (pass/fail, with
the drill ID), self-ratings (including clearing a rating), and flashcard difficulty ratings. Hint and solution openings are not
tracked. The client drops queued openings and the server discards them from
cached clients; earlier opening events are excluded from report aggregates.
No names, student IDs, code drafts, typed answers, keystrokes, general navigation,
IP addresses, or arbitrary error text are stored by this application. Normal
hosting logs still apply. Historical local progress is not uploaded; tracking
starts after opening the class link. Clearing local progress does not delete
previously recorded events. Anonymous browser IDs do not establish attendance
or identify unique people across browsers/devices.

The browser queues bounded events individually in local storage and sends them
automatically. It retries after connection failures and reloads; unique event
IDs make retries idempotent. A maximum of 500 unsent events protects browser
storage; the notice reports when it cannot keep additional events. Unavailable
browser storage means queued events survive only while the page stays open.
Data is grouped by server receipt time, so delayed offline events appear on
reconnection. The report supports 7, 30, and 120 days and includes currently
covered skills plus any later skills with activity.

The private Google Sheet's Class patterns tab shows self-rating counts, attempt
and incorrect counts, and browsers whose latest checked example is incorrect.
Unrated/untried skills are never counted as failures. Retries are attempts, not
additional participants. Activity feed also contains flashcard measures. Three code drill columns come last
(checks, checks not passed, and browsers that passed a drill for the skill), so
existing Sheet columns keep their positions. Legacy hint and solution
columns remain zero for compatibility with the existing Sheet importer. Self-ratings use the latest rating recorded inside
the selected window. Practice results may follow hints and are not grades.

The Sheet imports aggregate CSV using a private read key. IMPORTDATA refreshes
about hourly while open (Google: https://support.google.com/docs/answer/12188454).
It is not a real-time dashboard. The report includes generation and latest-event
timestamps. Keep the Sheet restricted: its Connection tab contains the read key.
The class link authorizes sending only; it cannot read the report.

Hosted secrets `REPORT_KEY` and `CLASS_CODE` are managed through Sites and never
included in public assets or source. `/api/activity` is write-only; every request
checks class code, browser key, origin, size, and allowlisted event schema.
`/api/report.csv` requires the separate private read key and returns aggregates,
never per-browser histories. Its bounded 50,000-event read fails visibly when a
reporting period is too large instead of silently truncating data.

`db/schema.ts` and generated `drizzle/` files own schema changes. Applied
migrations are immutable. The legacy manual-check-in tables remain for source
and data preservation but have no exposed routes and are not in the new report.
Use `npm run db:generate` for new changes and inspect generated SQL before
publishing. `build-hosted.mjs` packages an explicit public asset allowlist; server
source, tests, migrations, and local databases are not public assets.

`npm test` checks payload minimization, real SQLite persistence, secret-protected
reporting, deduplication, browser queue retries/reloads, and denominators, plus
the existing practice tests. `node scripts/preview.mjs` runs a loopback-only
preview with disposable SQLite data; its test configuration is never deployed.
