## Version Control<br>
🔔**Question**: Have you ever made a mistake of overwriting a file or saving the wrong version?<br>
 
> Imagine that you’re collaborating with one of your labmates on a project. You’re both making changes to a document or a codebase. At one point, you both have changed the same lines in a particular document. How do you go about merging your changes?

This is why we use version control. **Version control** is a system that manages and records changes to files over time. The most commonly used version control system is called **Git** (others include Mercurial and SVN). Git keeps track of the differences in the repository each time you make a change. The entire history of the repository is tracked by Git. If you realize you made a mistake in your code, you can always roll it back to a previous time point.

If you have used Google Docs, you likely have already used version control. Google Docs now tracks every change that every user makes, and allows you to go to any version of the document. Git allows us to do the same thing in complex code environments.

## Understanding Git Concepts: HEAD, origin, and main

Before we dive into the workflow, let's understand some key Git concepts that you'll encounter throughout this lesson.

### Visual Git Repository Structure
```
Remote Repository (GitHub)
         ↓
    origin/main  ← Points to latest commit on remote main branch
         ↓
Local Repository
         ↓
      main      ← Your local main branch
         ↓
      HEAD      ← Points to your current location/commit
```

### **HEAD**
- HEAD is a pointer that shows where you currently are in your repository
- Usually points to the latest commit on your current branch
- When you make a new commit, HEAD moves forward to point to it
- Think of HEAD as "You are here" marker

### **origin**
- `origin` is the default name for your remote repository (usually on GitHub)
- When you clone a repository, Git automatically names the remote "origin"
- Commands like `git push origin main` push to the remote repository
- You can have multiple remotes, but origin is the main one

### **main**
- `main` is the name of the default branch in your repository
- Previously called "master" in older repositories
- This is where your stable, production-ready code typically lives
- Other branches are created from main and eventually merged back

### The Relationship Between Them
```
GitHub (Remote)     →     origin/main
      ↓
Your Computer       →     main (local branch)
      ↓
Current Position    →     HEAD
```

When you:
- `git push`: Sends your local commits to origin
- `git pull`: Brings changes from origin to your local branch
- `git commit`: Moves HEAD forward to the new commit

## Git Workflows: Personal Workflow
There are a variety of workflows you may employ when using Git to track your changes. The most common, particularly for academic settings, is the **personal workflow**.

<br><img src="../../img/personal.png" alt="forking" width="50%">

In the personal workflow, you are largely going to be the only person adding to the repository. You have one **branch**, or version of your project. It is called the `main` branch. Every time you make changes to the code, you'll add them to the `main` branch. 

The main goal with version control settings is keeping track of the changes that you, the main user, are making to your repository. You don't have to worry about handling multiple people working on the repository at once, which simplifies the workflow. This is the first setting we will work in for this workshop.

## GitHub
Git is often used in tandem with a cloud-based hosting platform -- we have been using **GitHub** (but there are others include Gitlab and Bitbucket). Recall that GitHub is a hosting service for Git repositories. It allows you to store your Git projects in the cloud and provides a platform for collaborating with others. The benefit to using GitHub is that it makes it easier to collaborate on code with others via its web platform.<br>
 
In this lesson, we're going to use Git in command line and GitHub to make updates to a repository.  <br>

Recall that a **repository** (or repo for short) is a central place where all the files related to a project are stored. It includes your project’s code, documentation, and a record of every change made to the files over time, managed through a version control system like Git. <br>

## Managing Local and Remote Repositories
Recall that there is a local repository and a remote repository. **The local repository** is the version of the code that is stored on your computer. **The remote repository**, meanwhile, is any version of the repository that lies on some other machine. In this context, remote repository is almost always going to refer to the version that is on on GitHub's servers. <br>

So, when we're making changes to a repository, we need to synchronize the local and the remote. The steps we outline keep track of those changes between both cases, while also keeping track of the entire history. GitHub provides a nice platform on which we can peruse the history of a repository.<br>
<br><img src="../../img/workflow.png" alt="forking" width="50%"><br>

1. **Commit**: Save your selected changes with a description.
2. **Push**: Upload your saved changes to GitHub for others to see.
3. **Pull**: Download the latest updates from GitHub to your project.

For Git from command line, there are two more command you will use: `add` and `status`
<br><img src="../../img/committing.jpeg" alt="forking" width="50%"><br>

Let's go through the process of making changes to a repository, step by step.<br>
 
### 1. **Creating a Repository**
Let's create another repository on GitHub. Click on this [link](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/create-a-repo) and follow the instructions. Make sure to tick the `Add a README file` box under "Initialize this repository with". Click on `Create repository`. You now have a remote repository (on GitHub's servers), but **not** a local repository.<br>

Alternatively, you can create a repository locally first using `git init`. This command initializes a new Git repository in your current directory, creating a `.git` folder that contains all the version control information.<br>

🥊**Challenge**: Let's create a new repository under your account. <br>

### 2. **Cloning** 
Recall that cloning a repository means taking a remote repository, and copying it to our local machine to create a local repository. On the command line, we run the command `git clone [REPO-LINK]` to do so, filling `[REPO-LINK]` with the link to your repository.<br>
The terminal will ask for your username and password. Use your Github username as the username and the personal token we created as the password. 

🥊**Challenge**: Let's clone a repository. <br>
💡 **Tip**: In command line (Bash /Zsh), `cd` is used to change directories and `ls` is used to look at the list of files in a directory.

### 3. **Checking the status** 
A useful command to always run is `git status`. This will provide a summary of what's going on in your repo. Run it to see what happens - all it should say is that it's up to date with origin/main: this means that it's up to date with origin, which is its name for the remote repo. Within origin, it's synced to the main branch. <br>

### 4. **Making a Change** 
Let's make changes to the repo. Let's make a change by creating a new file. Create a file called `text.txt`, which has some text in it of your choosing. You can also add a new text file by `touch [text_file_name]`, make new directories, or edit the `README` file.  
<br>
🥊**Challenge**: Let's make changes to your **local** repository.  <br>

🔔**Question**: Do you see these changes on your GitHub? <br>
🔔**Question**: What does it say when you run `git status`? <br>

### 5. **Staging** 
The first step to codifying this change in the git history is to stage it, which is done with the `git add` command. Once a change is "added", it is placed in a staging area. You can think of this as a "proposal" for the next record in the Git history. The proposal is made permanent in the following step. To add the file, `run git add test.txt`. <br>

🔔**Question**: What does it say when you run `git status`? <br>
🥊**Challenge**: what happens if you do `git add --all`. <br>

### 6. **Committing a Change** 
Committing changes entails taking a snapshot of them: once we do this, the changes are frozen and placed in the `git` history. Each commit needs an accompanying message to say what the reason for the commit is. Make sure these messages are informative - your future self will thank you!<br>
Commit the file by running `git commit -m "adding new folders and files"` or any comment you think are appropriate. 

🔔**Question**: What should be our next line of code/command? <br>

### 7. **Pushing to the Remote Repository** 
Right now, the local repo knows about the changes we did, but the remote repo doesn't. So, we need to synchronize the two by "pushing" our changes to the remote repo. We do by `git push origin main`. we are pushing the changes we made to `origin`(the name of the remote repo), on the `main` branch. Interface will ask for your username and password (token). <br>

### 8. Check GitHub
Let's check the GitHub page to see if the changes you made manifest on the website! <br>

### 9. Make Edits and Commits on GitHub Directly
Recall you can make changes to the remote repository by making changes GitHub page directly. Let's do that now. <br>

### 10. Pull Changes from Remote
Recall that when you make changes on GitHub directly, your local repository doesn't automatically know about them. Use `git pull` to bring those changes to your local machine:<br>
```bash
git pull origin main
```

So, even in the personal workflow, there's a lot of individual steps needed just to make changes to the codebase. This becomes a little bit more complicated when multiple people are making changes at the same time, which requires a slightly different workflow.<br>

## Additional Essential Git Commands

Now that you understand the basic workflow, let's explore some additional commands that will help you work more effectively with Git.

### **git log** - Viewing Commit History
The `git log` command shows you the commit history of your repository. It displays information about each commit including the commit hash, author, date, and commit message.
```bash
git log                    # Shows full commit history
git log --oneline         # Shows condensed one-line per commit
git log --graph           # Shows branch structure visually
```

### **git diff** - Viewing Changes
The `git diff` command shows the differences between various states of your repository:
```bash
git diff                  # Shows unstaged changes
git diff --staged         # Shows staged changes (ready to commit)
git diff HEAD~1           # Shows changes since last commit
```

### **git reset** - Undoing Changes
The `git reset` command allows you to undo changes in different ways:
```bash
git reset <file>          # Unstage a file (remove from staging area)
git reset --soft HEAD~1   # Undo last commit, keep changes staged
git reset --hard HEAD~1   # Undo last commit and discard changes (careful!)
```

⚠️ **Warning:** `git reset --hard` permanently deletes changes. Use with caution!

### **git checkout** - Switching and Restoring
The `git checkout` command has multiple uses:
```bash
git checkout <branch>     # Switch to a different branch
git checkout <file>       # Restore file to last committed state
git checkout <commit>     # View repository at specific commit
```

💡 **Tip** Do `git pull` before working on a repository so that your local repo is up to date with your remote repo.
